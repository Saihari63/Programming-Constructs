ASSIGNMENT 1: PSEUDOCODE DEVELOPMENT

TASK 1: Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then ouypuys the result. Incomplete conditional and looping constructs.




STEP 1: Start
STEP 2: Prompt the user to enter a number and store it in variable (num)
STEP 3: Initialize a variable to store the result (result)
STEP 4: Check if the number is even:
           a. If yes, then:
           i. Calculate the square of the number and store it in result variable
           b. If no, then:
           i. Calculate the cube of the number and store it in the result variable
STEP 5: Print output the result
STEP 6: Ask the user if they continue: (Yes/No)
STEP 7: If the user wants to continue:
           a. Go back to step2
STEP 8: If the user doesn't want to continue:
           a. End
